Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max and I'm a junior data analyst.

I've just graduated from the course "Data Science Specialist" by Yandex.Practicum. I'm looking forward to get a job in the sphere of data analytics. My dream is to analyze users' feedback and improve different mobile services by doing that.

About me:

Before entering the course by Practicum I've learnt by myself the basics of various programming languages: SQL (Transact, My, Oracle), Excel (M, VBA, DAX) and Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy). I'm now eager to learn more about analytical methods and broaden my hard skills in Python which would be applicable for analytical work.

I've graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2022 as a Bachelor, my field of study was Economics so I have intermediate knowledge of math statistics, linear algebra etc.

I enjoy learning new languages and studying geography.
